# Face Detection and Adversarial Attacks

This is a repository for "Face Detection and Adversarial Attacks" project. 
These tools implement several popular face-detection algorithms (HoG and YOLOv3) as well as a variety of adversarial attacks.
The resulting changes to face detection can be visualized and quantified to determine whether the attacks ''beats'' the detector.

## Setup and Installation

Here are some directions on setting up your environment 

## Running Face Recognition

## Running Adversarial Attacks

## Testing Recognition after Attack
